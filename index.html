				<ul>
					<li><b>BHP Release Automation:</b> Leveraged various monitoring points within the Bowen Basin to facilitate automated control of mine-water dam release points during high-rainfall periods. The project included SCADA, HMI, and PLC programming.</li>
					<li><b>Aquila Mine SCADA Overhaul:</b> Executed a comprehensive SCADA system overhaul for the Aquila underground coal mine, introducing a streamlined interface that significantly reduced breakdown downtime through optimised alarm masking and intuitive visualisation of equipment interlocks.</li>
					<li><b>Commissioning of Remote Pressure Skids:</b> Orchestrated the commissioning of remote gas pressure monitoring skids, integrating them into the Citect SCADA via 5GHz radios with 900MHz redundancy.</li>
					<li><b>Citect SCADA Rest API:</b> Conceptualised and implemented a RESTful API wrapper for Citect ctapi, providing the flexibility of interfacing through web requests as opposed to traditional connectivity to the ctapi.dll file.</li>
					<li><b>Various SCADA and PLC Projects:</b> Accomplished a series of SCADA and PLC projects for Anglo American Aquila and Grasstree underground coal mines, encompassing various applications such as sewage treatment plants, emulsion plants, dewatering, conveyors, and dust suppression and monitoring.</li>
					<li><b>Grasstree Care and Maintenance Transition:</b> Efficiently transitioned the control systems infrastructure to a care and maintenance phase, skilfully coordinating the decommissioning of ventilation gas monitoring to avoid unnecessary power trips or operational delays.</li>
					<li><b>Collision Avoidance System:</b> Designed and prototyped a LIDAR-based collision avoidance system for the RAAF to prevent EWP collision with aircraft.</li>
					<li><b>Battery Management System HMI:</b> Designed and developed an HMI using a 7" capacitive touch screen and a Raspberry PI to manage battery charging cycles for the Team Arrow solar-powered race car, the Arrow One.</li>
